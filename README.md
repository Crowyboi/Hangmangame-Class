# Hangmangame-Class
this is a class which allowes you to play hangman

So this class can be implemented into other programs if you want to 
simple do this var Game1 = new thehangedman("samplestring",6);
and replace the 6 with the number of attemps that can be made 
if you need to find the status of the game if it has been beaten simple use the public bool status 
if you want the turnsleft use the public int turnsleft
if you need to display the string that is being solved use strdisplay

Main.cs is a demonstation of it
Hope you have fun with it 
if there is somehting wrong with it or there is something i could improve please tell me
any feedback will be appriciated
